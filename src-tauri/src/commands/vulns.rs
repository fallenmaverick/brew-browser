//! v0.5.0 — IPC handlers for the opt-in vulnerability-scanning surface.
//!
//! Four commands, mirroring the trending-history pattern from
//! [`crate::commands::trending`]:
//!
//! - [`vulns_scan_all`] — full-install-set scan. Gated by
//!   [`AppState::require_vulnerability_scanning`]. Short-circuits via
//!   the install-set fingerprint when nothing has changed since the
//!   last successful scan.
//! - [`vulns_scan_one`] — single-formula scan, used by the
//!   PackageDetail "Check vulnerabilities" affordance.
//! - [`vulns_install_helper`] — one-click installer for the
//!   `brew vulns` subcommand itself. Gated by the *master* paranoid
//!   switch only — the per-feature toggle is intentionally bypassed
//!   so the user can install the helper before flipping the toggle on
//!   (typical first-time flow: "I want to enable scanning" → install
//!   helper → toggle on → scan).
//! - [`vulns_invalidate`] — drop a single cache entry. Ungated; called
//!   after every upgrade/uninstall so a stale CVE record can't outlive
//!   the version it referenced.
//!
//! ## Gating composition
//!
//! Every gate decision happens **before** any subprocess spawn or
//! cache load. The cache is lazy-hydrated from disk on the first scan
//! in the process (avoids paying the file-read cost when the user
//! never opts in).
//!
//! ## Persistence
//!
//! After every mutation (`put`, `record_fingerprint`, `invalidate`)
//! the cache is flushed via `save_if_dirty` so a crash mid-session
//! doesn't lose work. Save failures bubble up as `BrewError::Io`.
